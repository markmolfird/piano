The piano app is a lite and easy-to-use web application for playing and learning piano. It is built purely based on web technologies.

You can play your favorite song with the built-in keyboard, or mouse. There is also an option to record the desired song(s) and replay it at any time. In total, there are 52 keys but only 20 of them are visible when you first install the app for the first time. This number can be increased from the options page (open sidebar). An option is also available to hide the built-in keyboard (top section). Moreover, the sustain control option makes songs to last a bit longer (for a more professional piano playing). 

You can install this app as a PWA on your mobile device, moreover, it is available as a browser extension as-well-as a web application:
