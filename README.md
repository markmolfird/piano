The piano app is a lite and very easy to use web application for playing and learning Piano.

You can play your favorite music with the built-in keyboard, or mouse. There is also an option to record the desired song(s) and replay it at any time. In total, there are 52 keys but only 20 of them are visible when you first install the app for the first time. This number can be increased from the options page (open sidebar). An option is also available to hide the built-in keyboard (top section). Moreover, the sustain control option makes songs to last a bit longer (for a more professional piano playing). Overall, this app is user-friendly and very lite software available for your browser.

This app is available as a browser extension as well as a web application:
